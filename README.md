# Fall Detection Using MediaPipe and Transformer-Based Deep Learning  

This project focuses on detecting different **human postures and fall events** using **MediaPipe-based pose data** and a **Transformer-based deep learning model**.  
The dataset consists of labeled **human posture classes** such as **falling, standing, sitting, lying down, and more** to train and evaluate the model for **real-time fall detection**.

---

##  Features
✅ **Data Preprocessing** – Normalizes and reshapes **time-series pose data** collected using **MediaPipe**.  
✅ **Transformer-Based Neural Network** – Implements a **custom Transformer model** for **sequential pose classification**.  
✅ **Evaluation Metrics** – Computes **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**, and visualizes **confusion matrices and ROC curves**.  
✅ **Real-Time Prediction Capability** – The model can **classify human postures and detect falls** in real-time.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains **pose keypoints captured using MediaPipe**, representing different human postures.

| Class       | Description                        | Label |
|------------|------------------------------------|-------|
| **Falling**  | Fall event detected               | 0 |
| **Stand Up** | Transition from seated/lying      | 1 |
| **Standing** | Normal standing posture          | 2 |
| **Lie Down** | Moving to a lying position       | 3 |
| **Sit Down** | Sitting posture                  | 4 |
| **Lying**    | Fully lying down                 | 5 |

Each CSV file consists of **sequential pose keypoint data**, reshaped into **3D arrays** for input into the **Transformer model**.

Drops unnecessary columns (midpoint_1, midpoint_2, central_point).
Normalizes data using MinMaxScaler.
Reshapes pose keypoints into time-series sequences for Transformer input.
- Model Architecture
Custom Transformer-based deep learning model for sequence classification.
Multi-head self-attention layers, followed by feed-forward layers.
Global average pooling and dense layers for classification.
- Training and Evaluation
Splits dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%).
Implements early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Visualizes performance with: ✅ Confusion matrices
-  ROC curves
-  Accuracy/loss plots
