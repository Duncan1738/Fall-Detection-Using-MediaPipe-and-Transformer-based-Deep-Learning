# Fall-Detection-Using-MediaPipe-and-Transformer-based-Deep-Learning

ðŸ“‰ Fall Detection Using MediaPipe and Transformer-based Deep Learning
This project focuses on detecting different human postures and falls using MediaPipe-based data and a Transformer-based deep learning model. The dataset consists of several human posture labels such as falling, standing, sitting, lying down, and more, which are used to train and evaluate the model for real-time fall detection.

ðŸŒŸ Features
Data Preprocessing: Normalization and reshaping of time-series pose data collected using MediaPipe.
Transformer-based Neural Network: Implements a custom Transformer model for sequential data classification.
Evaluation Metrics: Calculates accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and visualizes confusion matrices and ROC curves.
Real-time Prediction Capability: Model can classify and detect fall events based on pose data.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview
The dataset contains pose keypoints captured using MediaPipe, representing various postures:

Class	Description	Label
Falling	Falling event detected	0
Stand Up	Standing up from a seated/lying position	1
Standing	Standing posture	2
Lie Down	Transition to lying down	3
Sit Down	Sitting posture	4
Lie	Lying down	5
Each CSV file consists of sequential pose keypoint data, which is reshaped into 3D arrays for input into the Transformer model.

ðŸ”§ Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Loads pose data from CSV files.
Drops unnecessary columns (midpoint_1, midpoint_2, central_point).
Normalizes the data using MinMaxScaler.
Reshapes the data into time-series batches for input to the Transformer model.
Model Architecture:

Uses a custom Transformer-based architecture for sequence classification.
Multi-head self-attention layers are followed by feed-forward layers.
Applies global average pooling and dense layers for classification.
Training and Evaluation:

Splits the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Implements early stopping with validation monitoring.
Visualizes model performance using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and accuracy/loss plots.
